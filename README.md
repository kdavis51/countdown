# This project involves a button, a buzzer and a count down

Upon running the program the clock displays 2:00, a user can initiate the count down by pushing the button.  Once the clock starts counting down, the button is disabled until the countdown is completed.  When the clock hits 0:00, a buzzer alarms.   This behavior will continue until the user presses the button once more to reset the clock and turn off the buzzer.    The user can enjoy the count down sequence once more by pressing the button to start the countdown.
